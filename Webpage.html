    <p style="color: #987e7e;">Jing Yuan (Chinese: 景元) is a playable character in Honkai: Star Rail.
        He is one of the seven Arbiter-Generals of the Xianzhou Alliance's Cloud Knights, and one of the Six Charioteers of the Xianzhou Luofu. Although he appears lazy, Jing Yuan has been a general on the Luofu for centuries, an amount of time exceeding most of his peers. This can be attributed to his wisdom and attention to routine measures, with Jing Yuan preferring to be preventive rather than corrective.</p>
